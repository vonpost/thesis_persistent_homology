          First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Yishao Zhou for supporting my ideas, helping me find data for the case studies and helping me acquire computational resources to complete this project. I would also  like to thank the Insect Sensory Ecology and Cognition Lab at the Department of Zoology (Stockholm University) and the Division of Computational Science and Technology (KTH) for providing me with the data for the two case studies. In particular, I would like to thank Johannes Hjorth and Emily Baird for giving me insight into their respective domains. Finally I would like to thank my girlfriend Mira, who put up with me through all of this.

          The computations of in Section 4.2 were enabled by resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at the High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N) partially funded by the Swedish Research Council through grant agreement no. 2021-22166.
