First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Yishao for supporting my ideas, helping me find data for the case studies and helping me acquire computational resources to complete this project. I would also  like to thank the Department of Zoology at Stockholm University and the Department of (?) at KTH for providing me with the data for the two case studies. In particular, I would like to thank Johannes Hjorth and Emily Baird for giving me insight into their respective domains. Finally, I would like to thank Mira who had to put up with me through all this.
